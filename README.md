PICTURE -> YOSSI SAADI FULL STACK ENGINEER<br>

### Hey GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yossi Saadi, 28, lives in the beautiful :raised_hands: land of Israel :israel:<br>
Recently graduated my B.Sc degree in Software Engineering :student:<br>

Works @Duda for the past 2 years as an Automation Engineer, using Selenium w/ Java.<br>
Remotely for the past half-year. :mask:<br>
On my day-to-day work I'm writing complex tests, and building automation infrastructure, both for tests and for integrating with external services - such as Logz.io (which was a GAME CHANGER!), AWS, etc.. - to increase the power, accuracy and abilities of automation, and therefore making Duda's products better and more stable for our customers.<br>
During my time @Duda as an Automation Engineer, I also got to develop few features for production users, using React and Java, as I also have experience with front-end frameworks.<br>
I also got as-well to write unit tests using React Testing Library, Mocha, Jest, etc..<br>

I use tools as GitHub, JIRA, Logz.io, and more to perform my work and been using a variety of other amazing tools on my spare-time and during my studies.<br>

Aiming to have a career as a Full-Stack engineer (using React & Node).<br>
Except React I also want to deeply learn Vue 3, as I believe the more frameworks and technologies you know, the better developer you are, as you learn from the best.<br>

My B.Sc final project was a React Native app, and I got 97 for it.<br>
A smart social netwrok for selling and buying tickets for events between individuals. <br>
Whether it is football games, concerts and more, the app (using Neural Netwrok for recommendation system) recommends tickets for users by analyzing their activity, and does not require users to fill a form to publish a post, but just to enter free-text describing what it wants to sell, and the app (using smart NLP and huge self-made data-set) figures out for the user when the event should take place, who are the entities related to the event and whether it is a sell or a looking-to-buy post.<br>
The app supports both English and Hebrew, and works fluently on both iOS and Android.<br>
The lecturer praised the work been done and the excellent result, saying it was the best project that came out under his guidance, and decided to take it a step further and publish it on the different stores, making it a private startup and maybe looking to expand it when the user base would grow high in numbers.<br>
I believe that in few years SoldApp would be the standard :wink:<br>

I learned A LOT during this project (and slept NONE for a year :dizzy_face:). <br>
Me and my partner worked as a small startup with high and advanced standards, such as microservices.<br>
We bought a domain for our app (soldapp.co) and used sub-domains for each of our microservices:<br>
- Firestore/Firebase cloud functions - building lambda functions with Node on GCP for all Firebase-related actions<br>
- NLP analyzer <br>
- NN for the recommendation system <br>
- Server<br>
- Client<br>

We also used Github PR mechanism and performed CR for each line of code, Github Actions for CI/CD, JIRA to handle the huge amount of tasks and even more tools.<br>

Except all the technologies I've used and mentioned above, I also use sometimes Pythoon, and been reading a lot about (and implemented while learning Node) Blockchain related stuff. <br>
I learned deep fundamentals of Blockchain independently, and have deep familiar with cryptocurrencies and consensus algorithms.<br>
On my spare time I love to read and take online courses related to my work and expand my knowledge :brain:.<br>

As you can understand, my moto in life is -> Work Hard, Play Hard!<br>
