### Hey GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yossi Saadi, 28, lives in the beautiful :raised_hands: land of Israel :israel:<br>
Recently graduated my B.Sc degree in Software Engineering :student:<br>

Works @Duda for the past 2 years as an Automation Engineer, using Selenium w/ Java.<br>
Remotely for the past half-year. :mask:<br>
On my day-to-day work I'm writing complex tests, and building automation infrastructure, both for tests and for integrating with external services - such as Logz.io (which was a GAME CHANGER for Duda's automation!), AWS, etc.. - to increase the power, accuracy and abilities of automation, and therefore making Duda's products better and more stable for our customers.<br>
During my time @Duda as an Automation Engineer, I also got to develop few features for production users, using React and Java, as I also have experience with front-end frameworks.<br>
I also got as-well to write unit tests using React Testing Library, Mocha, Jest, etc..<br>

I use tools as GitHub (Actions, PR and CR mechanism), JIRA, Logz.io and more to perform my work and been using a variety of other amazing tools on my spare-time and during my studies.<br>

Aiming to have a career as a Full-Stack engineer (using React & Node).<br>
Except React I also want to deeply learn Vue 3, as I believe the more frameworks and technologies you know, the better developer you are, as you learn from the best.<br>

My B.Sc final project was a React Native app, A smart social netwrok for selling and buying tickets for events between individuals.<br> 
The mobile world is also something that I'm enthusiastic about, especially cross-platform ones as RN and Flutter.<br>

Except all the things I've used and mentioned above, I also use sometimes Pythoon, and been reading a lot about (and implemented while learning Node) Blockchain related stuff. <br>
I learned deep fundamentals of Blockchain independently, and have deep familiar with cryptocurrencies and consensus algorithms.<br>
On my spare time I love to read and take online courses related to my work and expand my knowledge :brain:.<br>

As you can understand, my moto in life is -> Work Hard, Play Hard!<br>
